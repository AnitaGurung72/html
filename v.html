    <h2 style=" text-align: center;">Flora found in mustang</h2>
    <img src="flower.jpg" alt="flower">
    <strong>A flora of the Mustang valley in north-central Nepal. The Mustang region is of special interest for its
        aridity and high degree of floral endemism. Overgrazing of pastureland beyond the capacity of the land to
        regenerate and cutting of small trees and shrubs for firewood has contributed significantly to habitat change.
        Similarly, with the rise in temperatures, the impact of climate change is clearly visible. These threats to such
        an interesting flora have demanded more detailed studies of Mustang's plant resources and their adaptive
        capabilities. The present publication is the latest outcome of the joint work of the Nepalese Department of
        Plant Resources (DPR) and the University of Tokyo.
